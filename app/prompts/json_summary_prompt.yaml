      summarize the user input that includes medical data on a person's history of colonoscopy procedures and the pathology reports from the polyps that were removed.
      key information includes the following:
      - include patient's name
      - include the patient's NHI 
      - for patient's age, only include the year and omit the month.
      - Populate the indication field with sps if the indication is serrated polyposis syndrome.  If the indication is either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, use ibd as the indication
      - Additional possible indications include family history category 1, 2 or 3.  If the indication is family history but the category is not specified, use family_history_unknown as the indication.  Other possible indications include positive_faecal_immunochemical_test, anaemia, rectal_bleeding, change_in_bowel_habit, abdominal_pain, weight_loss, surveillance_for_previous_polyps, screening, other or unknown
      - dates of the procedure written in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.
      - if the cecum was reached.  This should be a binary outcome as either yes or no
      - The Boston Bowel Prep Score - an integer between 0 and 9 representing the total score and then individual scores for each of the segments right colon, transverse colon and left colon

      - for each polyp that was removed, include the following information in a separate dictionary:
      - location of the polyp - possible locations include cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum
      - the size of the polyp which is generally reported in millimeters - less than 10mm or greater than or equal to 10mm is a useful cutoff
      - the histology of the polyp which should be one of the following: adenoma, tubulovillous or villous adenoma, sessile serrated polyp, hyperplastic polyp  
      - presence of dysplasia in the polyp - none, low grade, or high grade
      - the resection status of the polyp - complete, piecemeal, not resected or unknown
      - the retrieval status of the polyp - complete, incomplete, or unknown
      - all of the dictionaries for the polyps should be included in a list under the key "polyps" for each colonoscopy procedure
      format the output as ***JSON output*** with the following schema for each colonoscopy procedure.
