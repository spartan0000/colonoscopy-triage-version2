      summarize the user input that includes medical data on a person's history of colonoscopy procedures and the pathology reports from the polyps that were removed.
      key information includes the following:
      - include patient's name
      - include the patient's NHI 
      - for patient's age, only include the year and omit the month.
      - Only populate the indication field if the indication is serrated polyposis syndrome.  Otherwise, leave it blank
      - dates of the procedure written in the format of YYYY-DD-MM.
      - if the cecum was reached.  This should be a binary outcome as either yes or no
      - The Boston Bowel Prep Score - an integer between 0 and 9
      - the number of polyps
      - the size of the polyps which is generally reported in millimeters - less than 10mm or greater than or equal to 10mm is a useful cutoff
      - the histology of the polyps.  
      - for adenomas - the number of polyps 
      - for the size of the largest adenoma - size expressed as an integer, whether there is high grade dysplasia (yes/no), whether the adenoma is tubulovillous or villous (yes/no)
      - for sessile serrated polyps - the number of sessile serrated polyps, the size of the largest sessile serrated polyp, whether there is dysplasia (yes/no)
      - for hyperplastic polyps - size greater than or equal to 10mm (yes/no)
      format the output as ***JSON output*** with the following schema for each colonoscopy procedure.
